# SEED
SEED is an application that reads ReviewManagers XML-files, auto-generates some content and places it into wiki-markup.<br>
You can download SEEDs first version here: https://github.com/CochraneSchizophrenia/SEED/releases/tag/FirstRelease

Recently, we got some feedback that the "Summary" part on top of the SEED  table needs to be paraphrased further, since it does not agree with Wikipedia's open license. Until there is a second release, please paraphrase it manually or delete this section before posting a table.
